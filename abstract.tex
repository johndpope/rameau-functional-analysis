Functional harmonic analysis is an interesing and difficult problem in
computer music research. In this paper we describe the implementation
of a framework for functional harmonic analysis, together with three
algorithms for functional analysis, in Rameau, a system for automatic
harmonic analysis.

This infrastructure allows easy experimentation with different
harmonic analysis techniques, generates prettily typeset analysed
scores (with the aid of GNU LilyPond), has some built-in mechanisms
for evaluating harmonic analysis algorithms, and, due to being in
Rameau, is completely open source.
